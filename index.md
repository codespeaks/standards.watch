    <p>Business intelligence for Web standardization.</p>

</header>

* Are you struggling to measure your company's activity at W3C or in other Web standard bodies?
* Do you find it hard to understand what the competition is doing?
* Do you not know who's driving key specs forward nor which organization they belong to?
* Are you unable to measure your efforts and report them to management to justify resources, or get new ones?
* Is your strategy based on intuition and experience rather than data?
* Are you basically operating in the dark?

If so, you're not alone.

But what if instead you could:

* understand your company's participation in W3C and assess your team's impact with real data,
* know which company is driving a spec, or what areas your competition is focusing on,
* know which implementors are active and where,
* be up to date on the IP commitments you're making on behalf of your company,
* keep management and other teams up to date with your W3C activity?

As a former AC Rep, I would have loved to receive this information in my mailbox every week, ready to be shared across my company and to inform strategic decisions.

Today, it's possible to build business intelligence reports of Web standards activity based on data collected from GitHub, mailing lists, IRC channels, and other sources. These reports can be tailoed to your specific needs, and shipped to your inbox, on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis.

Before embarking to build such a product, I'd love to see if there's interest from W3C members.

It shouldn't take you more than 5 minutes, and it will help me help you. :)

All answers are strictly confidential and won't be shared with anyone.

If you've expressed interest by filling out this survey, I'll keep you posted when the project launches.

Thanks a lot for your input and feel free to share this with other people you think would be interested.
